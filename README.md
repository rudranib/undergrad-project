## An Efficient Rebroadcast Video Detection Algorithm Using Local Binary Patterns and Colour Moments

Jan 2019 â€“ May 2019

Project description:

Created a database by capturing 80 videos and created 320 recaptured videos by recapturing them through different screens and cameras. Implemented an SVM classifier by using features such as local binary patterns, color moments, and other statistical measures such as correlation coefficients and energy ratios in order to differentiate between an originally captured video from a recaptured video on different frame sizes. Achieved the highest accuracy for a frame size of 512 pixels.
